 Self managed package installation (`sudo apt`)

 Longer run times (idle nodes are removed after 7 days)

 More hardware behind the cluster 

 Specialized research group and course offerings.

 Larger pods with up to 8 cores and 16GB RAM.

 Latest version of VSCode and Rstudio web apps.

Instructional Ecosystem


General Availability


The https://hub.ics.uci.edu site includes a wide number of extensions.   These extensions will come and go during the quarter based on availability, usefullness, load, and security.  Please send any requests for new extensions to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu.


Specific Course Hubs


Instructors may request a course specific hub.  Available plugins will not change during the quarter except in response to extreme security  vulnerabilities.  Course hubs can be restricted to enrolled students and students on a list curated by the instructor.  Upon request, instructors may be given rights to view student projects.

FAQ and Troubleshooting


How do I debug C++ code in VSCode


A  Install the C/C++ IntelliSEnse extension for VSCode:


https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-cpptools





Q My pod is stopped after 1 hour of idleness (3600 seconds)

A By defualt, jupyterhub culls idle pods after 3600 seconds.   That has been extended to 1 week on stage.     Culling User Pods


Q I receive the error “Please use a different workspace.” 

Please use a different workspace.
This workspace is already in use in another JupyterLab window. 
Please enter another workspace name.

Q “503 : Service Unavailable Your server appears to be down. Try restarting it from the hub.” 

You ran out of space or have too many files on your home directory (H:).  Delete files as needed.

A You already have a Jupyterlab browser open.  Simply type in a name for the new desktop, anything you like, and click on “Switch Workspace”.


Q Are we using our own docker hub


A  We run Harbor locally.


We were very happy with it until version 1.9 implemented an AD specific directory search.  We are currently running an ICS fork but, if the folks at 
goharbor do not fix it, we will need to find another solution.


Q RStudio does not have the same installed packages as R 


A Use the following command to add the local conda library to your RStudio session

     .libPaths( c( "/opt/conda/lib/R/library/" , .libPaths() ) )
     
     

Q Desktop blank or only shows a black background.


A  In the past this has happened when moving from an older version of the hub to a newer one.   See fi the following steps resolve the issue:


 Click on the stop server button in https://hub.ics.uci.edu/hub/admin#/

 ssh into openlab.ics.uci.edu and `rm -rf ~/.jupyterhub ~/.config/xfce4`

 Start a new server in https://hub.ics.uci.edu/hub/admin#/ (or log out and back into https://hub.ics.uci.edu



Troubleshooting


Submitting a Trouble Report


Places to get help


First and foremost, bring the problem to your instructor's or TA's attention.   Chances are you are not the only one experiencing this problem and they will be able to help or provide you with the next steps to resolving your problem.


Your instructor may ask to you submit a trouble report to the ICS Computing Support Helpdesk if they don't have the solution or if you need more help than they can provide.


How to submit


In order to submit a helpdesk, please include the following information in an email to helpdesk@ics.uci.edu:


 ICS Account Name

 Hub Insance (e.g. ics51, ics53)

 Location(e.g. Home, Openlab, Middle Earth)

 Campus VPN

 Operating System

 Browser

 Hub Applications (e.g. desktop, termlina, R)

 Time and date that the problem occured

 Symptom/Issue.



Can't Delete Pod


Symptoms


See https://helpdesk.ics.uci.edu/Ticket/Display.html?id=73077

kubectl  -n jhub-ics53 delete pod jupyter-dingruiz
...
Events:
  Type     Reason         Age                    From                  Message
  ----     ------         ----                   ----                  -------
  Warning  FailedKillPod  2m19s (x55 over 111m)  kubelet, centaurus-5  error killing pod: failed to "KillContainer" for "notebook" with KillContainerError: "rpc error: code = Unknown desc = operation timeout: context deadline exceeded"

Fix


Try this:

kubectl  -n jhub-ics53 delete pod jupyter-dingruiz

If that doesn't work:

kubectl  -n jhub-ics53 delete pod jupyter-dingruiz --now

When all else fails:

kubectl  -n jhub-ics53 delete pod jupyter-dingruiz --grace-period=0 --force  

Can't Start a Server


Symptoms


See helpdesk ticket 73286


It appears as if the server failed to start:





Running `kubectl -n jhub log jupyter-junjies1`, immediately after opening starting the jhub server, revealed log messages regarding permissions.


Solution


In this case, the user home directory was set to 0700.  Setting the user home directory to 0711 resolved the problem.
