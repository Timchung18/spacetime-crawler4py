hello I am going to the store today.  I want to buy some bread to eat later.
I want to buy bread because I like to make sandwiches.
If you want to come, feel free to I'm always looking for more people to go with.
Sometimes I run into other people at the store and I wonder if we could go together but I know that all of our schedules are busy.
